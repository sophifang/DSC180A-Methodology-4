**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**


**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**


**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
For our Quarter 1 Project, our team's current approach involves working independtly on coding tasks in separate GitHub repositories and sharing our progress during our weekly section meetings. A potential change I'd love to make to this approach is to switch to working out of one GitHub repository for our Quater 2 Project. I think this would be beneficial because it will give us more practice with version control and working with different branches. We could also practice reviewing each other's code through approving pull requests. The last benefit would be that this would allow our team to delegate tasks and move at a more efficient pace while staying on the same page about research findings and key insights.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
