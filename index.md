**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\


**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\


**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
For our Quarter 1 Project, our team's current approach involves working independtly on coding tasks in separate GitHub repositories and sharing our progress during our weekly section meetings. A potential change I'd love to make to this approach is to switch to working out of one GitHub repository for our Quater 2 Project. I think this would be beneficial because it will give us more practice with version control and working with different branches. We could also practice reviewing each other's code through approving pull requests. The last benefit would be that this would allow our team to delegate tasks and move at a more efficient pace while staying on the same page about research findings and key insights.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\
So far, I've had the opportunity to learn a variety of ML modelling techniques via the demand forecasting and supply optimization phases of our Quarter 1 Project. As someone who is interested in pursuing more business-focused roles post-grad, I would love to create a public-facing "product"/interactive user interface at the end of the capstone that will allow users to interact with our model. For example, this [Erlang Calculator](https://www.callcentretools.com/tools/erlang-calculator/) is a website that returns the number of agents required on staff for a call center to reach a specific service level given user-populated fields. I would love to learn the web development techniques needed to implement a feature with similar functionality in our project.
